% It's split between having about half as true and half as false. 
% Of the false, half are the correct answer + 1,
% half are the correct answer - 1.

% several times below.

% set the number of numbers used in each question.

% equation.

% set the equation solution: 
% for each row, the answer is just the actual answer +/0 difference.
